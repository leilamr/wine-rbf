### Wine Dataset classification with RBF using MATLAB
#### Networks settings:
```
Train data = 70%, test data = 30%
Normalization = minmax
Spread = 2.550;
Maximum number of neurons = 10
Number of neurons to add between displays = 1
Epochs = 100

Average accuracy = 96.453%
```

#### Cross-validation
Settings:
```
K = 10
Normalization = minmax
Spread = 2.550;
Maximum number of neurons = 10
Number of neurons to add between displays = 1

Average accuracy = 86.042%
```
